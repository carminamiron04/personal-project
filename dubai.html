            <p class="lead mb-4">
                I was dreaming about this destination since i was a kid. I don't know exactly what was the thing/ place that triggered this desire of visiting Dubai, but as soon as i landed i fell in love with this city. If you're a big city lover, or you like to combine both, the city life and the island life, this is the place for you. Keep on reading to find out the best things to do in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p>
            <h2>How many days in Dubai and Abu Dhabi?</h2>
            <p>TEN to FIFTHEEN DAYS. There are a lot of activities you can do in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. If you want a holiday where you visit different places and get to know their culture, then i'll suggest you to take a ten days holiday, but if you want to also take some time for youself and get some rest at their beach clubs, i will suggest to go for more days.</p>
            <h2>When to visit Dubai?</h2>
            <p>SEPTEMBER to MAY. September to May is high season. Prices for lodging are high, but this is the best time of the year, and the most pleasant time to visit. Sea temperatures are a soul-warming 23C and an average of ten hours of sunshine per day makes it the perfect spot for winter sun. During summer months the weather is super hot, even though the prices are low, i don't suggest you to visit during that times.</p>

                <h2>What to visit in Dubai & Abu Dhabi?</h2>
            <p><strong>Dubai Creek</strong></p>
            <p>Head to historic Dubai Creek and hop from cab to quayside for a stirring trip into Dubai’s past. Have a nostril-tingling snoop around musky Deira Wharf and its serpentine Spice Souk, before gawping at the more-than-bling Gold Souk — the jewellery and diamond ring emporiums assault the senses as much as the wallet.</p>
            <p><strong>Burj Khalifa</strong></p>
            <p>Make time to visit the world’s tallest tower — the Burj Khalifa. Instead of taking the standard lift option to the 125th floor, you’re going to strut in like a VIP for the heart-in-mouth ‘At the Top, Burj Khalifa Sky’, the 148th-floor observation deck. It’s a splurge, but worth it; as well as the extra floors, you get the royal queue-jumping experience (essential for short stays) and such treats as pressed juices and plump dates to boot.</p>
            <p><strong>Dubai Mall</strong></p>
            <p>The largest indoor shopping centre in the world, Dubai Mall might not have a fully frosted ski run, like its neighbour Mall of the Emirates, but it’s much more of a pleasure to wander around. Its polished black-and-white hallways are lined with fashion designers, tech companies and gift shops, while creative displays of couture Arabic gowns and £1,000 shoes hang like artwork in the windows. With an aquarium bang in the middle and restaurants dotted around the edge, it’s also a good place to start or end for visits to the Burj Khalifa, Souk Al Bahar or the impressive Dubai Fountains that leap into life every hour or two.</p>
            <p><strong>Desert Safari</strong></p>
            <p>The desert is just outside of town and although you don’t have to stay overnight, it’s absolutely worth the cash if you do. The way most people see it is on an afternoon/evening desert safari. You’re picked up in the early afternoon and driven out of town for some dune-bashing, wildlife-spotting or a falconry display, plus dinner in a (recreated) Bedouin camp.</p>
            <p><strong>Jumeirah Beach</strong></p>
            <p>Start your day with a morning swim under holiday-blue skies at Jumeirah Beach — a dip in the gentle waves lapping those soft-sieved sands is the ultimate energiser after a flight.</p>

            <p><strong>MIRACLE GARDENS</strong></p>
            <p>Villa del Balbianello sits on the outskirts of Lenno. When you exit the ferry, walk to your left following the water until you see the sign for the villa. At the sign there are two options to reach the villa: pay a few Euro to join a water taxi (five minutes) or a free walk through the park (15 minutes). I opted for the walk, not realizing how stunning the villa is to approach by water until I did the return by water taxi. I highly recommend using this service both directions.</p>
            <p><strong>GLOBAL VILLAGE</strong></p>
            <p>This is a 19th century neo-classical villa located in Bellagio. It isn’t nearly as popular as the villas in Lenno, Tremezzo or Varenna, but worth a quick visit to see the gardens and lake views while in Bellagio.</p>
            <p><strong>DUBAI MARINA</strong></p>
            <p>This expansive handsome villa is the neighbor to Villa Cipressi on Lake Como’s eastern shoreline. Villa Monastero sits perched over a terraced garden bursting with plants, trees and flowerbeds including agaves, palms, wisteria, magnolia, citrus, roses and more. One of the prettiest private boat docks sits in front of the villa – stone columns rise up from a set of stone steps that lead down to the water.</p>
            <p><strong>BURJ AL ARAB</strong></p>
            <p>A functioning hotel set in a 17th century villa overlooking a beautiful botanical garden that can be visited by outside guests. Pathways wind their way through the terraced garden where lush greenery spills down into the lake. Don’t miss the grand cast-iron gate that opens up to a set of stone steps that lead into the water (this is the villa’s private boat jetty). Villa Cipressi is prettiest in April when the purple wisteria is in full bloom.</p>
            <p><strong>GRAND MOSQUE (ABU DHABI)</strong></p>
            <p>Villa Carlotta is located on the banks of Tremezzo, just steps away from the ferry jetty. The villa now serves as a museum, and ticketed entry includes access to both the museum and the botanical gardens.</p>

            <h2>Where to stay?</h2>
            <p><strong>Mandarin Oriental Jumeira, Jumeirah</strong></p>
            <p>Located in the low-rise, high-end Jumeirah neighbourhood, the Mandarin Oriental has a beach-side location that benefits from two incredible views — one out over the Arabian Gulf, and the other back over Dubai’s dramatic skyline, with the Burj Khalifa at its centre. While it may share its stretch of seafront with the Jumeirah public beach and running track, the hotel still feels private enough, and there are huge pools to sprawl around — one on the ground level, and one on the sixth floor alongside Portuguese restaurant Tasca. The spa, as you’d expect from Mandarin Oriental, is excellent, as is the Mandarin Cake Shop where a largely local crowd comes to nibble Saint Honoré and mille-feuille.</p>
            <p><strong>Atlantis The Palm, Palm Jumeirah</strong></p>
            <p>Crowning the top of the Palm Jumeirah, it’s difficult to grasp the scale of the 1,500-room Atlantis at first, sprawling as it does over an expanse of beach and palm-filled gardens. If Walt Disney had created an Arabian-aquatic theme park, it might have looked a lot like this. Practically every surface is covered in marine motifs, from the Chihuly glass sculptures in the lobby to the intricate ceiling frescoes, rooftop marlin sculptures, and columns covered in fish scales. There’s an aquarium that’s home to 65,000 marine creatures — you can even book a sub-aquatic suite that looks directly into it — and 105 slides and attractions, some gentle, some terrifying, at the adjacent Aquaventure Waterpark.</p>
            <p><strong>SLS, Dubai Design District</strong></p>
            <p>Topped by twin infinity pools and the Privilege bar and nightclub, the SLS doesn’t shy away from its party-hard credentials, although soothing pinks and rose gold are the tones of choice in guestrooms, perhaps in anticipation of the morning after. Downtown-facing rooms and suites have jaw-dropping views of the Burj Khalifa, as does the terrace of female-led Italian restaurant Fi’lia. For an extraordinary evening, 12 Chairs — seating 12 guests only — offers caviar bumps eaten straight off the back of your hand, crispy seaweed shell tacos piled high with kaluga, and even a madeleine topped with Iranian Albino caviar. It’s suitably extravagant.</p>

              <h2>Where to eat?</h2>
                <p><strong>CE LA VI</strong></p>
                <p>This contemporary eatery with Far Eastern accents is perched up on the 54th floor of the Address Sky View and deservedly dazzles the culinary crowd. CÉ LA VI is one of Asia's most well-known rooftop venues, with outposts in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and atop Singapore's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and its Dubai incarnation boasts breathtaking views of the Burj Khalifa from the terrace.</p>
                <p><strong>BRUNCH AND CAKE</strong></p>
                <p>This Barcelona-born coffee shop is famed for its often brightly-coloured, Instagrammable dishes – especially the breakfasts. The popular spot on Jumeirah's 51 Wasl development was the eatery's very first flagship cafe outside of Spain. Everything is homemade and fans in Dubai can expect brunch classics with a twist – think eggs Benedict served on a charcoal-sweetcorn waffle, a healthy take on a Snickers bowl and brownie pancakes with chocolate sauce.</p>
                <p><strong>MI AMIE</strong></p>
                <p>This place is just amazing. Food, service and ambience everything is just perfect. Staff are very friendly, kind and helpful. And the view, can't get enough of it. It oriented to the museum of the future, and totally recommand visiting it during the night.</p>
                <p><strong>URLA</strong></p>
                <p>Located on the Fountain Level at the Address Downtown Dubai hotel, URLA is designed around the concept of a coastline, with the terrace treating diners to prime views of the dazzling Burj Khalifa and The Dubai Fountain. Why settle for just dinner when you can have a show? We recommend heading over early so you can catch the sunset from your private table. The menu features the freshest produce from both land and sea, all of which are exclusive to the Aegean coasts of Spain, Greece and western Turkey. Expect a novel take on traditional dishes too, making it a fabulous foodie find.</p>
